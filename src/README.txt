ShoeConverter

ShoeConverter is a Java SWT Project that I created as part of the tech branch of my sneaker blog, Clean Your Shoes. In this application, it imports a simple API I built that has a set of HashTables that has Mens and Womens US Shoe sizes with their UK and EU equivalents.

In the application, currently a runnable JAR, the user will input a US size, select the Men or Women radio button, and then press conver to see their US, EU, and UK size in a US/UK/EU format I wrote in.

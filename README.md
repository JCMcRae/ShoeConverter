# ShoeConverter

## Introduction
ShoeConverter is a standalone Java SWT application that allows users to convert their current shoe size to and from US, UK, and EU shoe size systems.

This program requires Java 8.

## How to Deploy
In order to use this application, you need to compile `MainWindow.java`:

`javac MainWindow.java`

Depending on your IDE of choice, if you so choose to use one, it will do it for you. You just need to figure out how to do that. After it compiles, you need to convert it to a `.jar' file:

`jar -cf MainWindow.jar MainWindow.class`

Then, you can simply run the .jar file, but if you have a wrapper program that turns the .jar to an .exe, that's okay, too.

## EOL WARNING
This version has reached end of life, and is deprecated. The updated version of this is ShoeConverter-Alpha.
